A very small v8 javascript runtime for linux only

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/just-js/binder/HEAD)

## Philosophy/Goals
- small, secure, robust and performant js runtime for linux
- small codebase. easy to understand and hack
- very simple layer on top of system calls, v8 and c/c++ standard libraries
- minimal use of classes/function templates and OO - "c" in javascript
- favour return codes over exceptions
- platform for building system software on linux in javascaript
- as close to native performance as possible
- modules can be dynamically loaded shared libaries or can be statically compiled into runtime
- secure by default
- avoid abstraction as much as possible. abstractions can be built in userspace
- be able to write busybox in js using this
- don't necessarily care about browser compatibility, but a compatibility layer could be added in userland
- don't necessarily care about all ES features, but a compatibility layer could be added in userland
- commonjs modules, no support for ES modules
- non-async by default - can do blocking calls and not use the event loop
- event loop in JS-land. full control over epoll api
- small standard library - leave as much to userland as possible. focus on primitives needed to build higher level abstractions
- useful as a teaching/learning platform for linux system programming and learning more about javascript and v8 internals
- small number of files - keep everything in one header/source file if possible
- keep LOC as small as possible < 5k
- allocate as little as possible on v8 heap
- resource lifetime is responsibility of the caller ?? what do i mean here?
- blessed modules live in modules repo
  - must adhere to guidelines
  - must have tests
  - breaking changes in runtime can be fixed by just maintainers
- foundation for ownership/governance
- c-like api - can create object models in js
- auto discovery for modules - if we find a makefile. if we find an index.js

## Prerequisites
- builds on debian/ubuntu with precompiled libv8
- g++
- make
- curl (to download dependencies)

## Build

### Runtime Only
```
make runtime
```
- basic runtime for running external scripts

## build builder runtime
```
JUST_HOME=$(pwd) make runtime-builder
```
- this runtime enables self building and packaging

## self build with builder runtime
```
JUST_HOME=$(pwd)/.just just build runtime-builder
```
- binary will be in .just directory under current directory by default 

## Issues

- move issues to github issues
- openssl with static build - how to solve?

## self build to a target directory with builder runtime
```
JUST_TARGET=$(pwd)/foo JUST_HOME=$(pwd)/foo/.just just build cleanall runtime-builder
```
- binary will be in foo directory under current directory

## Summary
- 15 MB static binary, 17 MB dynamic
- 8MB startup RSS for static binary, 12 MB for dynamic
- less than 5k loc
- builds in 4 seconds

## Roadmap
- harden codebase. check all return codes. handle buffer overruns. handle bad arguments
- test suits and fuzz tests
- benchmarks
- examples
- module system
- docker builds

## Todo
- remove all throws in lib/*.js
- add shm operation - https://gist.github.com/garcia556/8231e844a90457c99cc72e5add8388e4
- add file operations
- add getaddrinfo - not in static build.. ugh! no...
- for static builds, have an option to disallow any external requires. only builtins allowed
- heap snapshot api: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump/blob/master/src/heapdump.cc
- latt at v8 isolate snapshot blob for startup
- free memory in thread spawn on thread completion
- test memory being freed in pg module
- do MIT licenses
